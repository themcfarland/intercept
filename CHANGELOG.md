# Changelog

All notable changes to iNTERCEPT will be documented in this file.

## [2.26.9] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **ADS-B bias-t support for RTL-SDR Blog V4** — When dump1090 lacks native `--enable-biast` support, the system now falls back to `rtl_biast` (from RTL-SDR Blog drivers) to enable bias-t power before starting dump1090. The Blog V4's built-in LNA requires bias-t to receive ADS-B signals. (#195)

---

## [2.26.8] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **acarsdec build failure on macOS** — `HOST_NAME_MAX` is Linux-specific (`<limits.h>`) and undefined on macOS, causing 3 compile errors in `acarsdec.c`. Now patched with `#define HOST_NAME_MAX 255` before building. Also fixed deprecated `-Ofast` flag warning on all macOS architectures (was only patched for arm64). (#187)

---

## [2.26.7] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Health check SDR detection on macOS** — `timeout` (GNU coreutils) is not available on macOS, causing `rtl_test` to silently fail and report "No RTL-SDR device found" even when one is connected. Now tries `timeout`, then `gtimeout` (Homebrew coreutils), then falls back to a background process with manual kill. (#188)

---

## [2.26.6] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Oversized branded 'i' logo on dashboards** — `.logo span { display: inline }` in dashboard CSS had higher specificity (0,1,1) than `.brand-i { display: inline-block }` (0,1,0), forcing the branded "i" SVG to render as inline which ignores width/height. Added `.logo .brand-i` selector (0,2,0) to retain `inline-block` display. (#189)

---

## [2.26.5] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Database errors crash entire UI** — `get_setting()` now catches `sqlite3.OperationalError` and returns the default value instead of propagating the exception. Previously, if the database was inaccessible (e.g. root-owned `instance/` directory from running with `sudo`), the `inject_offline_settings` context processor would crash every page render with a 500 Internal Server Error. (#190)

---

## [2.26.4] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Environment Configurator crash** — `read_env_var()` crashed with "Setup failed at line 2333" when `.env` existed but didn't contain the variable being looked up. `grep` returned exit code 1 (no match), which `pipefail` propagated and `set -e` turned into a fatal error. Fixed by appending `|| true` to the pipeline. (#191)

---

## [2.26.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **SatDump AVX2 crash** — SatDump now compiles with `-march=x86-64` on x86_64 platforms (Docker and `setup.sh`), preventing "Illegal instruction" crashes on CPUs without AVX2. SIMD plugins still use runtime detection for acceleration on capable hardware. (#185)

---

## [2.26.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Docker startup crash** — `.dockerignore` excluded the entire `data/` directory, which is now a Python package (`data.oui`, `data.patterns`, `data.satellites`). Caused `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'data.oui'` on container startup. Fixed by only excluding non-code files from `data/`.

---

## [2.26.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Default admin credentials** — Default `ADMIN_PASSWORD` changed from empty string to `admin`, matching the README documentation (`admin:admin`)
- **Config credential sync** — Admin password changes in `config.py` or via `INTERCEPT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var now sync to the database on restart, without needing to delete the DB

---

## [2.26.0] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **SSE fanout crash** - `_run_fanout` daemon thread no longer crashes with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` when source queue becomes None during interpreter shutdown
- **Branded logo FOUC** - Added inline `width`/`height` to branded "i" SVG elements across 10 templates to prevent oversized rendering before CSS loads; refresh no longer needed

---

## [2.25.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Inline style extraction** - `classList.toggle()` replaces inline `display` manipulation throughout codebase
- **Merged `global-nav.css` into `layout.css`** - Consolidated navigation styles
- **Reduced `!important` usage** - Responsive.css `!important` count reduced from 71 to 8
- **Standardized breakpoints** - Unified to 480/768/1024/1280px across all responsive styles
- **Mobile UX polish** - Improved touch targets, code overflow handling, and responsive layouts

### Fixed
- Deep-linked mode scripts now wait for body parse before executing, preventing initialization failures

---

## [2.24.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **WiFi Locate Mode** - Locate WiFi access points by BSSID with real-time signal meter, distance estimation, RSSI chart, and audio proximity tones. Hand-off from WiFi detail drawer, environment presets (Free Space/Outdoor/Indoor), and signal-lost detection.

### Changed
- Mobile navigation bar reorganized into labeled groups (SIG, TRK, SPC, WIFI, INTEL, SYS) for better usability
- flask-limiter made optional — rate limiting degrades gracefully if package is missing

### Fixed
- Radiosonde setup missing `semver` Python dependency — `setup.sh` now explicitly installs it alongside `requirements.txt`

## [2.23.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- GPS mode upgraded to textured 3D globe visualization
- Destroy lifecycle added to all mode modules to prevent resource leaks

---

## [2.22.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Waterfall control panel rendered as unstyled text for up to 20 seconds on first visit — CSS is now loaded eagerly with the rest of the page assets
- WebSDR globe failed to render on first page load — initialization now waits for a layout frame before mounting the WebGL renderer, ensuring the container has non-zero dimensions
- Waterfall monitor audio took minutes to start — `_waitForPlayback` now only reports success on actual audio playback (`playing`/`timeupdate`), not from the WAV header alone (`loadeddata`/`canplay`)
- Waterfall monitor could not be stopped — `stopMonitor()` now pauses audio and updates the UI immediately instead of waiting for the backend stop request (which blocked for 1+ seconds during SDR process cleanup)
- Stopping the waterfall no longer shows a stale "WebSocket closed before ready" message — the `onclose` handler now detects intentional closes

---
